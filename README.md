# house-heir-map

This project is a prototype made to map the Manor of the House Heir SMP.

It currently simply creates an SVG with each room inside.

# Setup the project

This project uses `pnpm` as its package manager. I recommend using `corepack` to manage `pnpm`, but feel free to get it how you want.

- Install the dependencies with `pnpm install`
- Start the dev server with `pnpm dev`
